As written in my short bio, this is my current collection of projects done either in school or as my own project.

Repositories starting with "SP" are projects i made for school and will just be meeting the requiermets set by the teacher. 
Repositories starting with "PP" are my personal projects. Very non-original ideas to test my skills and push my knowledge.

Some of the SP we did, came with a template to help us get started. But atleast 90% of the code is still mine in these projects.
